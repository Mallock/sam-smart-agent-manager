How to contribute to SAM application:

1. Understand the application: Before contributing or making any changes, take the time to understand the application's purpose, features, and functionality. It's important to have a good understanding of the existing codebase and the programming languages and frameworks used in the application.

2. Discuss any planned changes: Discuss any planned changes with other contributors, stakeholders, or the project lead. This step helps to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the changes and any impacts that they may have on the application.

3. Follow coding standards and best practices: Follow agreed-upon coding standards and best practices in the development process. This includes having a consistent style and formatting, commenting the code sufficiently, and adhering to naming conventions.

4. Use version control: Use version control tools such as Git or SVN to manage changes to the codebase efficiently. It's best practice to always create a new branch before making any modifications to the existing codebase.

5. Write clear and concise commit messages: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made to the codebase accurately. This step helps other contributors to understand the changes made, and why they were made.

6. Perform testing: Ensure that any changes made to the codebase do not cause any adverse effects on the application's existing functionality. Perform appropriate testing and debugging before submitting changes to the main branch.

7. Submit pull requests: After making any changes or improvements, submit a pull request to the main branch, highlighting the changes that have been made. Monitor any feedback or comments from reviewers and address them accordingly.

By following these guidelines, you can contribute effectively to the development of the SAM application and help improve its user experience.
